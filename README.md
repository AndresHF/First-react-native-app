<h2>Welcome</h2>
<h3>This app was made to learn and practice react-native</h3>
This app is just a base ( 2-16 ) to base ( 2-16 ) converter. I know there is thousands of apps like this, but I just wanted to try this using react native.
To check the app on your mobile, you need to have an Expo.io account and the Expo for android app installed.
To run in your mobile, please visit https://expo.io/@jaguars/base-converter .
